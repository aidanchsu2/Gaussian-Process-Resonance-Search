    """fit the input histogram with a GP using the input kernel

    optionally, blind the fit to a range of the histogram

    Parameters
    ----------
    histogram: hist.Hist
        histogram to fit a GP to
    kernel:
        kernel to use in GP
    blind_range: 2-tuple, optional, default None
        range of histogram to "blind" the fit to
        (i.e. do /not/ use this range of values in fit)
    kwargs: dict[str,Any]
        all the rest of the keyword arguments are passed to GaussianProcessRegressor


    Note
    ----
    The running of this fit can take a while. The GP is manipulating N-dimensional
    matrices where N corresponds to the number of training points. Since there are
    6000 bins in the input invariant mass histogram, N=6000 which are really large
    matrices and can take a long time to run.
    The manipulation of large matrices is a problem _built_ for GPUs and hence
    we may want to switch to a GPU-possible implementation of GPs like GPyTorch[1].
    In the mean time, I would highly recommend pickling[2] the resulting fitted GP object
    so that the fit doesn't need to be re-run if you just want to make different plots
    with the predictions the GP makes.

        import pickle
        with open('helpful-name-for-this-gp-fit.pkl','wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(gp, f)

    and then somewhere else (e.g. in a notebook where you are playing with plots) you can

        import pickle
        with open('helpful-name-for-this-gp-fit.pkl','rb') as f:
            gp = pickle.load(f)
