- re-organize code to be split across multiple files into a manageable form
- signal injector-inator optionally write to file
- mass resolution functions and auto-calculation of blind range
- search scan through mass points

CLI Tasks
- Single fit and plot
  - with blind range: show statistical calculation of likilhood excess is significant
- Inject signal (known and blinded), write output histogram to file and answer to separate file
  - known mass
  - rand mass (answer unknown to creator)
- Search: scan mass points, blinding and estimating p-value excess at each point
  - (optional) plot each mass point search as in single fit and plot
  - (optional) save each fit to pickle
  - p-value of excess at mass point plot
  - 95% CL maximum in window (for exclusion calculation)
